# Storage Account Tier

Storage Accounts have 2 Tiers which are Standard and Premium. Please see the difference below:

Premium storage are built on SSDs which offers high performance and low latency, making it ideal for latency-sensitive workloads like transactional databases and big data systems. Standard storage, on the other hand, utilizes HDDs and provides cost-effective storage for general-purpose use cases. 

Premium does not support GRS.
