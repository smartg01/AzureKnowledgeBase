# Management group governance

With management groups being the highest container in the hierachy, you can apply policies to this which then would scope to a group of subs.

Tenant root group is the highest management group that cannot be changed. You can then create further management groups which have better labels like "dev mg" or "prod mg"

- You can select the default MG in MG settings

- You cannot assign tags to MG layer.

- You can assign deployment and deployment stacks to the MG layer

- Cannot assign locks to the MG layer
